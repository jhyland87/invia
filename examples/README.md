# Examples

* **[Basic Example](https://github.com/jhyland87/invia/tree/master/examples/basic)** - Just a basic example usage
* **[Advanced Example](https://github.com/jhyland87/invia/tree/master/examples/advanced)** - Something a little more realistic, this is an example of how you can use *Invia* with other plugins to load pretty much everything programmatically, such as the routes, controllers, configuration file and all other HapiJS plugins (via Confidence)
